                <p>
                    I am a dedicated <strong>Software Engineer</strong> based in Mumbai, India, with over <strong>3
                        years of professional experience</strong> in the IT industry.
                    My journey started with a strong foundation in Backend technologies like <strong>ASP.NET
                        Core</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong>, and I have since expanded my skillset to include
                    Cloud Computing with <strong>Azure</strong> and modern Frontend development with
                    <strong>Angular</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am working at <strong>TechStalwarts</strong>, where I contribute to building robust
                    software solutions.
                    I am passionate about learning new technologies, optimizing code for performance, and delivering
                    high-quality products.
